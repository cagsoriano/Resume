Quick on my feet and eagerness to learn new things everyday is my greatest advantage. I see to it that I go the extra mile in everything that I do, from being a numbers-oriented category manager to being a loving homemaker. I thrive in picking up crucial details that would help me manage my daily activity and accomplish my responsibilities in an optimum. In my previous job, I was responsible for buying of products for the brand, vendor relationships, pricing, promotion encoding and allocation of items on all the company’s store front. Right now, I am looking for new endeavours that would help me build my talent as well as provide new grounds for a responsible and valuable career growth.
